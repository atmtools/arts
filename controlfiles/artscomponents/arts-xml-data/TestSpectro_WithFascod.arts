# Check functionality of Toolbox spectroscopic line data and consistency of
#  these with HITRAN spectroscopic catalogues.
#
# Version for Fascod species.
#
# CAUTION:
#   - HITRAN data is NOT included in the toolbox! Hence, for running the part
#      that uses HITRAN it is required that the user gets his/her own copy of
#      the HITRAN catalogue (and adapt path to the catalogue accordingly).
#   - This is a time consuming test!
