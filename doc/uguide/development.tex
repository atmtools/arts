% Introduction
%
The aim of this section is to describe how the program is organized
and to give detailed instructions how to make extensions. That means,
it is addressed to the ARTS developers, not the users. If you only
want to use ARTS, you should not need to read it. \textbf{But if you
  want to make changes or additions, you should definitely read this
  carefully, since it can safe you a lot of work to understand how
  things are organized.}

\section{Organization}
%====================
\label{sec:development:org}
 
ARTS is written in C++ and uses the cross-platform, open-source build system
CMake (\url{http://www.cmake.org/}). It is organized in a similar
manner as most GNU packages. The top-level ARTS directory is either called
\shortcode{arts} or \shortcode{arts-x.y}, where x.y is the release number. It
contains various sub-directories, notably \shortcode{doc} for documentation,
\shortcode{src} for the C++ source code, and \shortcode{aii} for the IDL
interface. The document that you are reading right now, the ARTS Developer
Guide, is located in \shortcode{doc/uguide}.

There are two different versions of the ARTS package: The development
version and the end-user version. Both contain the complete source
code, the only difference is that the developers version also includes
the SVN housekeeping data. If you want to join in the ARTS development
(which we of course encourage you to do), you should write an email to
the ARTS Development mailing list.
Furthermore, for serious development work you need a computer running
Unix, CMake, LaTeX, and the Doxygen program.  All
this is freely and easily available on the Internet, and, what is
more, all these tools are included in the standard Linux
distributions like \href{http://www.ubuntu.com/}{\nolinkurl{Ubuntu}} or \href{http://www.opensuse.org/}{\nolinkurl{openSUSE}}.

The end-user version contains everything that you need in order to
compile and install ARTS in a fairly automatic manner. The only thing
you should need is an ANSI-C++ compiler, and the CMake utility. Please
see files \fileindex{arts/README} and \fileindex{arts/INSTALL} for
installation instructions. We are developing with the GNU C++ compiler,
no other compilers have been tried so far.

\section{The ARTS build system}
%============================

As mentioned above, CMake is used to construct the ARTS
build system. A good introduction to the CMake system can be found in:
\begin{quote}
  \url{http://www.cmake.org/cmake/project/about.html}
\end{quote}
Using this tool makes a lot of things very easy, but also some
things slightly more complicated.

%The most important thing to keep in mind is that an ARTS release
%is not just a copy of the ARTS development tree. Instead there is a
%special make target `dist' that you can use to cut a release. How this
%is done in detail is described in Section \ref{sec:release}. Mostly,
%the GNU tools are smart enough to figure out automatically what should
%go into the release. However, this can be controlled by editing the
%\fileindex{Makefile.am} files which can be found in almost all directories.

The support for documentation other than info and man pages is not
very good in the GNU system, so we had to use some tricks to make sure
that the Doxygen automatic documentation and the User Guide work as they
should. 

\subsection{Configure options}
%========================================

Here are some interesting options for CMake:

\begin{description}
\item[\shortcode{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release}:] Removes '-g' from
the compiler flags and includes \shortcode{\#define NDEBUG 1} in
\fileindex{config.h}. The central switch to turn off all debugging
features (index range checking for vectors, the trace facility,
assertions,...). The default configuration \shortcode{RelWithDebInfo}
turns on some optimizations and provides debugging information.

\item[\shortcode{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug}:] This switch turns off all
optimizations. This should only be used if the default configuration
makes debugging a certain problem difficult.

\item[\shortcode{-DNO\_OPENMP=1}:] 
Disables the generation of multi-threaded code. CMake tries to detect if the compiler supports OpenMP and enables it by default.

\end{description}


%\subsection{Adding directories or files}
%%==================================
%
%If you add directories or just files, you have to make sure that they
%also go into the distribution. In some cases (e.g., program source
%code files) this is done automatically. But if you add any other kind
%of file, for example a data or a documentation file, you have to edit
%the \fileindex{Makefile.am} file in that directory to make sure that your
%stuff goes into the distribution. It is a good idea to always check
%the release in order to see if the things you added are really there.

\section{Conventions}
%===================
\label{sec:development:conv}

Here are some general rules for ARTS programming:

\subsection{Numeric types} Never use \shortcode{float} or
\shortcode{double} explicitly, use the type \typeindex{Numeric} instead.
This is set by CMake (to \shortcode{double} by default).
In the same way, use \typeindex{Index} for all integers. It can take on
positive or negative values and defaults to \shortcode{long}.
To change the default types, run \shortcode{cmake} with the options
\shortcode{-DINDEX=long} or \shortcode{-DNUMERIC=double}:

\begin{code}
cmake -DINDEX=int --DNUMERIC=float ..
\end{code}

Note that changing the numeric type to a lower precision type than
double might have unforseen impacts on the numerical precision and could
lead to wrong results. In a similar way, reducing the index type can
make it impossible to handle larger Vectors, Matrices or Tensors. The
maximum range of the index type determines the maximum number of
elements the container types can handle.

\subsection{Container types} Use \builtindoc{Vector} and
\builtindoc{Matrix} for mathematical vectors and matrices (with elements
of type \builtindoc{Numeric}). Use \shortcode{Array<something>} to
create an array of \shortcode{something}s.
Commonly used Arrays have been predefined, they have names like
\builtindoc{ArrayOfString}, \builtindoc{ArrayOfMatrix}, and so forth.

\subsection{Terminology}
Calculations are carried out in the so called workspace (WS), on
workspace variables (WSVs). A WSV is for example the variable
containing the absorption coefficients. The WSVs are manipulated by 
workspace methods (WSMs). The WSMs to use are specified in the
controlfile in the same order in which they will be
executed. 

\subsection{Global variables}
   Are not visible by default. To use them you have to declare them
   like this:
   \begin{quote}
   \shortcode{extern const Numeric PI;}
   \end{quote}
   which will make the global constant PI=3.14... available. Other important globals are:

   \begin{quote}
   \begin{tabular}{ll}
   \shortcode{full\_name}&         Full name of the program, including version.\\
   \shortcode{parameters}&        All command line parameters.\\
   \shortcode{basename}&          Used to construct output file names.\\
   \shortcode{out\_path}&          Output path.\\
   \shortcode{messages}&          Controls the verbosity level.\\
   \shortcode{wsv\_data}&          WSV lookup data.\\
   \shortcode{wsv\_group\_names}&   Lookup table for the names of \emph{types} of WSVs.\\
   \shortcode{WsvMap}&            The map associated with \shortcode{wsv\_data}. \\
   \shortcode{md\_data}&           WSM lookup data.\\
   \shortcode{MdMap}&             The map associated with \shortcode{md\_data}. \\
   \shortcode{workspace}&         The workspace itself.\\
   \shortcode{species\_data}&      Lookup information for spectroscopic species.\\
   \shortcode{SpeciesMap}&        The map associated with \shortcode{species\_data}.
   \end{tabular}
   \end{quote}
   The only exception from this rule are the output streams \shortcode{out0} to
   \shortcode{out3}, which are visible by default.

\subsection{Files}
Always use the \shortcode{open\_output\_file} and \shortcode{open\_input\_file}
functions to open files. This switches on exceptions, so that any
error occurring later on with this file will result in an
exception. (Currently not really implemented in the GNU compiler,
but please use it anyway.)

\subsection{Version numbers} 
The package version number is set in the \fileindex{ChangeLog} file in the
top level ARTS directory. Always increase this when you do a SVN
commit, even for small changes. In such cases increase the last digit
by one. If you make a new distribution, increase the middle digit by
one and omit the last digit. If you make a bug-fix distribution, you
can add the last digit to indicate this. 

\subsection{Header files} 
The global header file \fileindex{arts.h} \emph{must} be included by every
file. Apart from that you have to see yourself what header files you
need. If you use functions from the C or C++ standard library, you
have to also include the appropriate header file.

\subsection{Documentation}
Doxygen is used to generate automatic source code documentation. See
\begin{quote}
  \url{http://www.stack.nl/\~dimitri/doxygen/}
\end{quote}
for information. There is a complete User manual there. At the moment
we only generate the output as HTML, although latex, man-page, and rtf
format is also possible. The HTML version is particularly useful for
source code browsing, since it includes the complete source code! You
should add Doxygen headers to the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Files
\item Classes (Including all private and public members)
\item Functions
\item Global Variables
\end{enumerate}

The documentation headers are comment blocks that look like the
examples below. They should be put above the \emph{definition} of a
function, i.e., in the \shortcode{.cc} file.  Some functions are defined in
the \shortcode{.h} file (e.g., inline member functions). In that case the
comment can be put in the \shortcode{.h} file.

There is an Emacs package (Doxymacs) that makes the insertion of
documentation headers particularly easy. You can find documentation of
this on the Doxymacs webpage: \url{http://doxymacs.sourceforge.net/}.
To use it for ARTS (provided you have it), put the following in your
Emacs initialization file:

\begin{code}
(require 'doxymacs)

(setq doxymacs-doxygen-style "Qt")

(defun my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook ()
  (if (or (eq major-mode 'c-mode) (eq major-mode 'c++-mode))
      (progn
        (doxymacs-font-lock)
        (doxymacs-mode))))

(add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook 'my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook)

(setq doxymacs-doxygen-root "../doc/doxygen/html/")
(setq doxymacs-doxygen-tags "../doc/doxygen/arts.tag")
\end{code}

The only really important lines are the first two, where the second
line is the one selecting the style of documentation. The next block
just turns on syntax highlighting for the Doxygen headers, which looks
nice. The last two lines are needed if you want to use the tag lookup
features (see Doxymacs documentation if you want to find out what this
is).  The package allows you to automatically insert headers. The
standard key-bindings are:
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabularx}{.8\hsize}{@{}lX}
\texttt{C-c d ?} & look up documentation for the symbol under the point.\\
\texttt{C-c d r} & rescan your Doxygen tags file.\\
\texttt{C-c d f} & insert a Doxygen comment for the next function.\\
\texttt{C-c d i} & insert a Doxygen comment for the current file.\\
\texttt{C-c d ;} & insert a Doxygen comment for a member variable on the current line (like M-;).\\
\texttt{C-c d m} & insert a blank multi-line Doxygen comment.\\
\texttt{C-c d s} & insert a blank single-line Doxygen comment.\\
\texttt{C-c d @} & insert grouping comments around the current region.\\
\end{tabularx}
\end{quote}
You can call the macros also by name, e.g., \shortcode{doxymacs-insert-file-comment}.

\subsubsection{File comment}

Generated by \shortcode{doxymacs-insert-file-comment}.

\begin{code}
/*!
\file   dummy.cc
\author John Doe <john.doe (at) example.com>
\date   2011-03-02

\brief  A dummy file.

 This file has no purpose at all,
 it just servers as an example... 
*/
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Function comment}

Generated by \shortcode{doxymacs-insert-function-comment}. If
arguments are modified by the function you should add `[out]' after
the \shortcode{\char`\\ param} command, just like for the parameter
\shortcode{a} in the example below. If a parameter is both input and
output, you should say `[in,out]'. Parameters that are passed by
value or not modified inside the function should carry an `[in]'. The
documentation for each parameter should start with a capital letter and
end with a period, like in the example below.

Author and date tags are not inserted by default, since they would be
overkill if you have many small functions. However, you should include
them for important functions. 

\begin{code}
//! A dummy function.
/*! 
 This function has no purpose at all,
 it just serves as an example... 

\param[out]     a This parameter is initialized by the
                  function.
\param[in,out]  b This parameter is modified by the function.
\param[in]      c This parameter used but not changed by the function.

\return   Dummy value computed from a and b.         
*/
int dummy(int& a, int& b, int c);
\end{code}

\begin{code}
//! A dummy comment.
/*! 
 Some more elaborate description about this variable, 
 class, or whatever.

\section{Extending ARTS}
%======================
 \label{sec:development:extending}

\subsection{How to add a workspace variable}
%---------------------------------------

You should read Section \ref{sec:agendas:wsvs} to understand what workspace
variables are. Here is just the practical description how a new
variable can be added.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a record entry in file \fileindex{workspace.cc}. (Just add
  another one of the \shortcode{wsv\_data.push\_back} blocks.) Take the
  already existing entries as templates. The ARTS concept works best
  if WSVs are only of a rather limited number of different types, so
  that generic WSMs can be used extensively, for example for IO.
      
  The name must be \emph{exactly} like you use it in the source code,
  because this is used to generate interface functions.
  
  Make sure that the documentation string you give explains the
  variable and its purpose well. \textbf{In particular, state the
    dimensions (in the case of matrices) and the units!} This string
  is used for the online documentation. Please take some time to write
  it carefully. Use the template at the beginning of function
  \shortcode{define\_wsv\_data()} in file \shortcode{workspace.cc} as a
  guideline. 

\item That's it!
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to add a workspace variable group}
%--------------------------------------------

You should read Section \ref{sec:agendas:wsvs} to understand what workspace
variable groups are. Here is just the practical description how a new
group can be added.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add a \shortcode{wsv\_group\_names.push\_back("your\_type")} function to
  the function \shortcode{define\_wsv\_group\_names()} in \fileindex{groups.cc}.
  The name must be \emph{exactly} like you use it in the source code,
  because this is used to generate interface functions.
\item XML reading/writing routines are mandatory for each workspace variable
  group. Two steps are necessary to add xml support for the new group:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Implement an \shortcode{xml\_read\_from\_stream}
    and \shortcode{xml\_write\_to\_stream} function. Depending
    on the type of the group the implementation goes into one
    of the three files \fileindex{xml\_io\_basic\_types.cc},
    \fileindex{xml\_io\_compound\_types.cc}, or
    \fileindex{xml\_io\_array\_types.cc}. Basic types are for example Index
    or Numeric. Compound types are structures and classes. And array types are
    arrays of basic or compound types. Also add the function declaration in the
    corresponding \shortcode{.h} file.
  \item Add an explicit instantiation for
    \shortcode{xml\_read\_from\_file<GROUP>} and
    \shortcode{xml\_write\_to\_file<GROUP>} to \fileindex{xml\_io\_instantiation.h}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item If your new group does not implement the output operator
  (\shortcode{operator<<}), you have to add an explicit implementation
  of the \builtindoc{Print} function in \fileindex{m\_general.h} and
  \fileindex{m\_general.cc}.
\item That's it! (But as stated above, use this feature wisely)
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{How to add a workspace method}
%-------------------------------------
\label{sec:development:extending:wsm}

You should read Section \ref{sec:agendas:wsms} to understand what workspace
methods are. Here is just the practical description how a new
method can be added.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create an entry in the function \funcindex{define\_md\_data} in file
  \fileindex{methods.cc}.  (Make a copy of an existing entry (one of the
  \shortcode{md\_data.push\_back(...)} blocks) and edit it to fit your new
  method.) Don't forget the documentation string! Please refer to the
  example at the beginning of the file to see how to format it.
\item Run:
  \shortcode{make}.
\item Look in \fileindex{auto\_md.h}. There is a new function prototype
  \begin{quote}
    \shortcode{void <YourNewMethod>(...)}
  \end{quote}
\item Add your function to one of the \shortcode{.cc} files which contain method
  functions. Such files must have names starting with \shortcode{m\_}. (See
  separate HowTo if you want to create a new source file.) The header
  of your function must be compatible with the prototype in \shortcode{auto\_md.h}.
\item Check that everything looks nice by running 
  \begin{quote}
    \shortcode{arts -d YourNewMethod}
  \end{quote}
  If necessary, change the documentation string.

\item Thats it!
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to add a source code file}
%---------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create your file. Names of files containing workspace methods should
  start with \shortcode{m\_}.
\item You have to register your file in the file
  \fileindex{src/CMakeLists.txt}. This file states which source files
  are needed for arts. In the usual case, you just have to add your
  \shortcode{.cc} file to the list of source files of the artscore
  library. Header files are not added to this list.
\item Go to \shortcode{src} and run: \shortcode{svn add <my\_file>} to
  make your file known to SVN.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to add a test case}
%---------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tests are located in subdirectories in the \fileindex{controlfiles}
  folder. Instrument specific test cases are in the
  \fileindex{controlfiles/instruments} folder, all other cases are
  located in the \fileindex{controlfiles/artscomponents} folder. Create
  a new subdirectory in the appropriate folder. If your test is closely
  related to another test case you can skip this step and instead add it
  to one of the existing subdirectories.
\item Create your own test controlfile. The filename should start
  with \fileindex{Test} followed by the name
  of the subdirectory it is located in, e.g.
  \fileindex{controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts}.

  If the subdirectory contains more than one test controlfile,
  append a short descriptive text to the end of the filename like
  \fileindex{controlfiles/artscomponents/ montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGaussian.arts}.
\item Copy all required input files into the subdirectory. Input data that is
  shared among several test cases should be placed in
  \fileindex{controlfiles/testdata}.
\item Add an entry for your test case in
  \fileindex{controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to add a particle size distribution}
%---------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item In \shortcode{cloudbox.cc}, add a non-WS method
\shortcode{pnd\_fieldPSDNAME}, where \shortcode{PSDNAME} stands for the short
name or name tag of the new particle size distribution (PSD) parametrization.
This will be the method called by
\builtindoc{pnd\_fieldCalcFromscat\_speciesFields}, the WSM that converts the
particle-related atmospheric fields (typically hydrometeor fields like cloud ice
mass content, rain rate, etc.) to the internally used \builtindoc{pnd\_field}.
\item Update the built-in documentation of
\builtindoc{pnd\_fieldCalcFromscat\_speciesFields} in \shortcode{methods.cc}.
Particularly, add an entry in the table summarizing the implemented PSDs.
\item In \shortcode{m\_cloudbox.cc}, add a WSM \shortcode{dNdD\_PSDNAME} as a
wrapper to the low-level calculation of the number density size distribution
function $\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}D$. Also add definition and documentation of
the WSM to \shortcode{methods.cc} (see
Section~\ref{sec:development:extending:wsm} for details).
\end{enumerate}

\section{SVN issues}
%======================
 \label{sec:development:cvs}

The arts project is controlled by Subversion. This section describes some
basic SVN commands. For more information see the extensive SVN
documentation:
\begin{quote}
  \url{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/}
\end{quote}




\subsection{How to check out arts}
%-----------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to a temporary directory.
\item Run: \shortcode{svn co https://www.arts.mi.uni-hamburg.de/svn/rt/arts/trunk arts}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to update (if you already have a copy)}
%--------------------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to the top ARTS directory (called simply \shortcode{arts}).
\item Run: \shortcode{svn update}
   
  \textbf{IMPORTANT!} Always update, before you start to make changes
  to the program, especially after a longer pause. If you edit an
  outdated copy, it will be a lot more work to bring your changes into
  the current copy of the program.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to commit your changes}
%---------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item You should make sure that the program compiles and runs without
  obvious errors before you commit.
\item If you have created a new source file, make it known to SVN by
  running the command \shortcode{svn add <my\_file>} in the directory where
  the file resides.
  
  In general, when you run \shortcode{svn update}, it will warn you about
  any files it doesn't know by marking them with a \shortcode{?}. Files
  that are created during the compilation process, but should not be
  part of the package are ignored by SVN. You can view the list of ignored
  files for the current directory with \shortcode{svn propget svn:ignore .}.
  The list can be edited with \shortcode{svn propedit svn:ignore .}.
\item Have you added the documentation for your new features?
\item Open the file \fileindex{ChangeLog} in the top level ARTS directory
  with your favorite editor.
  
  With Emacs, you can very easily add an entry by typing either
  \begin{quote}
    \shortcode{M-x add-change-log-entry}
  \end{quote}
  or \shortcode{C-x 4 a}.
  
  Specify the new version number and describe your changes.

  \textbf{These keystrokes work also while you are editing some other
    file in Emacs. Thus it is best to write your ChangeLog entry
    already while you work on a file}. Whenever you make a change to a
  file, there should be a ChangeLog Entry!
\item Make sure that you have saved all your files. Go to the top
  level ARTS directory and run: \shortcode{svn commit}.
\item This will pop up an editor. Use the mouse to cut and paste the
  ChangeLog message also to this editor window. Safe the file and exit
  the editor. If you made changes in different directories, another
  editor will pop up, already containing your message. Save again and
  exit. Do this until no more editors come up. (Note: This works well
  if you set
  \begin{quote}
    \shortcode{export EDITOR=xedit}
  \end{quote}
  in your shell startup file.
 
  With smart editors there can be problems, because they might
  refuse to safe your file if you haven't made changes to it. With
  xedit you just have to push the save button twice to override.
\item Tell the other developers about it. The best way to do this is
  to send an email to \shortcode{arts-dev@www.sat.ltu.se}.
\end{enumerate}


% FIXME OLE
%\subsection{How to cut a release}
%%----------------------------
%\label{sec:release}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Change the release number in the file \fileindex{configure.in} in the
%  top-level ARTS directory. (The line that you have to change is the
%  one with \shortcode{AM\_INIT\_AUTOMAKE}.) Omit the subversion number (last digit).
%\item Commit your changes (see other howto). 
%\item In the top-level ARTS directory, run \shortcode{autogen.sh}.
%\item In the top-level ARTS directory, run \shortcode{make distcheck}. This
%  will not only cut the release, but also immediately try to build
%  it, to see if it works. Unless you are on a very fast machine, this
%  may take a while. Maybe you should go and have a cup of coffee.
%\item If all goes well, you can find the release inside the top-level
%  ARTS directory as a file \fileindex{arts-x.y.tar.gz}, where x.y is the
%  release number.
%\item Check the release carefully by trying to build and install the
%  program. 
%\end{enumerate}


\subsection{How to move your arts working directory}
%----------------------------------------------

In general it is no problem to move your working directory. Only when you are
using a build directory that is located outside the ARTS source tree, you
have rerun \shortcode{cmake PATHTOARTS} in that directory.

\section{Debugging (use of assert)}
%================================
\label{sec:development:assert}
 
The idea behind assert is simple. Suppose that at a certain point in
your code, you expect two variables to be equal.  If this expectation
is a precondition that must be satisfied in order for the subsequent
code to execute correctly, you must assert it with a statement like
this:
\begin{quote}
\shortcode{assert(var1 == var2);}
\end{quote}

In general assert takes as argument a boolean expression. If the
boolean expression is true, execution continues. Otherwise the
\shortcode{abort} system call is invoked and the program execution is
stopped. If a bug prevents the precondition from being true, then you
can trace the bug at the point where the precondition breaks down
instead of further down in execution or not at all.  The \shortcode{assert} call
is implemented as a C preprocessor macro, so it can be enabled or
disabled at will. 

In ARTS, you don't have to do this manually, as long as your source file
includes \shortcode{arts.h} either directly or indirectly. Instead, assertions
are turned on and off with the global NDEBUG preprocessor macro, which is
set or unset automatically by the \shortcode{cmake} build configuration.
Assertions are enabled in the default \shortcode{cmake} build configuration
(\shortcode{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo}). They are turned off in the
release configuration (\shortcode{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release}).

If your program is stopped by an assertion failure, then the first
thing you should do is to find out where the error happens. To do
this, run the program under the GDB debugger. First invoke
the debugger:
\begin{quote}
\shortcode{gdb arts}
\end{quote}
You have to give the full path to the ARTS executable.  Then set a
breakpoint at the assertion failure:
\begin{quote}
  \shortcode{(gdb) break \_\_assert\_fail}
\end{quote}
(Note the two leading underscores!) Now run the program: 
\begin{quote}
  \shortcode{(gdb) run}
\end{quote}

Instead of just exiting, under the debugger the program will be paused
when the assertion fails, and you will get back the debugger prompt.
Now type:
\begin{quote}
  \shortcode{(gdb) where} 
\end{quote}  
to see where the assertion failure happened. You can use the
\shortcode{print} command to look at the contents of variables and you
can use the \shortcode{up} and \shortcode{down} commands to navigate
the stack.  For more information, see the GDB documentation or type
\shortcode{help} at the prompt of GDB.

For ARTS, the assertion failures mostly happen inside the Tensor /
Matrix / Vector package (usually because you triggered a range check
error, i.e., you tried to read or write beyond array bounds). In this
case the \shortcode{up} command of GDB is particularly useful. If you
give this a couple of times you will finally end up in the part of
your code that caused the error.

Recommendation: In Emacs there is a special GDB mode. With this you
can very conveniently step through your code.
