    temperature itself should normally also be included, hence t_pert should
    always include 0. Must be sorted in ascending order!

    The vector t_pert may be an empty vector (nelem()=0), which marks
    the special case that no interpolation in temperature should be
    done. If t_pert is not empty, you will get an error message if you
    try to extract absorption for temperatures outside the range of
    t_pert. */

    These apply to all the species that have been set as

    Fractional units are used! Example: [0,.5,1,10,100],
    meaning from VMR 0 to 100 times the profile given in
    abs_vmrs. The reference value should normally be included, hence
    nls_pert should always include the value 1.

    If nonlinear_species is an empty vector, it means that there are
    no nonlinear species. Then nls_pert must also be an empty vector.

    \attention We want to interpolate these beasts in pressure. To
    keep interpolation errors small it is better to store
    cross-sections, not coefficients. The absorption coefficient alpha
    is given by alpha = xsec * n, where n is the number density.

    Dimension: [ a, b, c, d ]

    Simplest case (no temperature perturbations, no vmr perturbations): <br>
    a = 1 <br>
    b = n_species <br>
    c = n_f_grid <br>
    d = n_p_grid <br>

    Standard case (temperature perturbations, but no vmr perturbations): <br>
    a = n_t_pert <br>
    b = n_species <br>
    c = n_f_grid <br>
    d = n_p_grid <br>

    Full case (with temperature perturbations and vmr perturbations): <br>
    a = n_t_pert <br>
    b = n_species + n_nonlinear_species * ( n_nls_pert - 1 ) <br>
    c = n_f_grid <br>
    d = n_p_grid <br>

    Note that the last three dimensions are identical to the
    dimensions of abs_per_tg in ARTS-1-0. This should simplify
    computation of the lookup table with the old ARTS version.  */
