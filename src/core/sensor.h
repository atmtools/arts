   repeated usage. Before first call of this function, size H as
   H.resize( 4, 4 );
   The H returned of this function can be used as input for later calls. That
   is, no need to repeat the resize command above.

//! Calculate channel boundaries from instrument response functions.
/*!
  This function finds out the unique channel boundaries from
  f_backend and backend_channel_response. This is not a trivial task,
  since channels may overlap, or may be sorted in a strange way. The
  function tries to take care of all that. If channels overlap, they
  are combined to one continuous frequency region. therefore the
  number of elements in the output vectors fmin and fmax can be lower
  than the number of elements in f_backend and
  backend_channel_response. 

  The function also does consistency checking on the two input
  variables.
 
  The output vectors fmin and fmax will be monotonically increasing.

  \param[in]  f_backend                 Nominal backend frequencies.
  \param[in]  backend_channel_response  Channel response, relative to nominal frequencies.

   Calculates the (row) vector that multiplied with an unknown (column) vector

   Basic principle follows Eriksson et al., Efficient forward modelling by
   matrix representation of sensor responses, Int. J. Remote Sensing, 27,
   1793-1808, 2006. However, while in Eriksson et al. the product between f*g
   is assumed to vary linearly between the grid point, the expressions applied
   here are more advanced and are completly exact as long as f and g are
   piece-wise linear functions. The product f*g is then a quadratic funtion
   between the grid points.

   \param   f       The values of function f(x).
