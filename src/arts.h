    <h2>What is ARTS?</h2>

    ARTS-2: 3D version for polarized radiative transfer calculations
    including particle scattering. It includes almost all features of the first
    version and also a number of additional functions.

    One of the main new features is the implementation of particle
    scattering as for many applications, scattering of microwave radiation
    by ice particles in the atmosphere emerges as an important issue. The
    new model should be able to simulate realistic cloud cases for microwave
    measurements in limb sounding geometry. Modeling radiative transfer
    through clouds is a complicated topic for various reasons.

    The cloud coverage is vertically and horizontally strongly inhomogeneous
    which implies that a 3D model is unavoidable for simulating realistic
    cases. Especially for simulating limb measurements, a 3D geometry is
    required as the observed region in the atmosphere has a horizontally
    large extent. Clouds consist of a variety of hydrometeors. There
    are liquid water clouds but also cirrus clouds which consist of ice
    particles of different sizes and shapes. Particle scattering leads to
    polarization effects, therefore modeling only the first component of
    the Stokes vector, the scalar intensity, is not sufficient. At least
    the first two components are required, in some cases, depending on the
    formation of the cloud, even all four components.

    The VRTE (Vector Radiative Transfer Equation) is an inhomogeneous vector
    differential equation for the Stokes vector. This equation can be
    solved numerically using an iterative method. So far gaseous absorption
    is pre-calculated using the first version of ARTS and stored in a
    lookup table. The single scattering properties of the particles, i.e.
    extinction, absorption and scattering, are calculated using the T-matrix
    method and stored in a data base.

    The Zeeman effect is also currently being implemented.

    As the program is modular the user can adjust the control file according
    to his/her requirements. The atmospheric dimensionality can be chosen to
    be 1D, 2D or 3D. If clearsky calculations are performed without Zeeman
    effect it does not make sense to calculate all 4 Stokes components. And
    for special symmetries in the scattering region, which can be switched
    on or off, the 3rd and 4th component of the Stokes vector are negligible
    small. Thus the user also can also decide how many Stokes components
    shall be simulated.

    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    You can use the HTML version to browse the source text. Just point and
    click, and eventually you will see the real implementation of functions
    and classes.

    If you are looking for a more comprehensive text, check out the
    Arts User Guide that is also distributed along with the
    program. Section `Documentation' in Chapter `The art of developing
    ARTS' there also tells you how you should add documentation
    headers to your code if you are an ARTS developer.
