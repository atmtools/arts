    When called the variable ppath shall contain a description of the
    propagation path fine enough that it can be treated as piecewise
    linear. In addition, the spacing of the input ppath must be fine
    enough that altitudes, latitudes and longitides vary monotonically
    over each ppaths step. The function will not catch deviations from
    these criteria, neither crash, but the result will not be ideal.
   
    The output ppath contains all found grid crossings and other points
    added to meet l_step_max. Set a grid to be empty, to not add points
    for that dimension.
