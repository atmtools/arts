The variable works as a lookup-table of complex refractive index.
The matter type (water, ice ...) is unspecified, it is up to the
user to fill the variable with data for the expected matter.
This variable type can be used to describe n of both the surface and
atmospheric particles. For the surface, a dedicated variable exists:
*surface_complex_refr_index*.

The column dimension has always size 2, where the first and second
column holds the real and imaginary part of n, respectively. The row
dimension matches temperature, and the page dimension is frequency.
Both the temperature and frequency dimensions grids are allowed to
have length 1, which is interpreted as n being constant in that
dimension.

When mapping these data to the required frequencies and temperatures
a bi-linear interpolation is applied.

Using a single block for each retrieval quantity has is advantageous for

The default for output is to give data for the selected Stokes

The polarisation states/components are coded as
  (0) Undefined.
  (1) I, total intensity.

  (6) Ih, intensity of horizontally polarised component.
  (7) I+45, intensity of +45 deg linearly polarised component.
  (8) I-45, intensity of -45 deg linearly polarised component.
  (9) Ilhc, intensity of left-hand circularly polarised component.
  (10) Irhc, intensity of right-hand circularly polarised component.

See the documentation for definition of the Stokes vector and the
different components.

If the instrument measures, or transmits, vertical and horizontal
components, this variable shall accordingly be set to [5,6].

Conversion to Planck-BT of components 2-4 requires that component
1 is kept, and must be included as first element.

The shift from the Stokes vector can be made at any stage when of the
sensor response set-up. The responses used must of course be adopted
correspondingly. Or reversed, if the antenna response is defined for
Iv or Ih it could be useful to shift polarisation as first sensor
operation.

Some methods sets and updates *iy_id*. The general numbering scheme is::

  xxxyyycba

where xxx identifies the row in sensorPos/los (i.e. the mblock_index),
yyy identifies pencil beam direction inside measurement block (should
in general match a row in mblock_dlos), and cba identies later legs
of total propagation paths, where a, b and c identifies secondary, tertiary
and quaternary part, respectively. 1-based numbering is used. That is,
the primary path of the first pencil beam of the first measurement block
has iy_id = 001001000.

Accordingly, the primary propagation path has cba = 000. If the primary path
intersects with the surface, and the downwelling radiation is calculated
for three directions, these secondary paths get cba = 001, 002 and 003.
If tertiary paths appear, they have numbers such as 011.

    Description: The maximum diameter (or dimension) of the scattering

    volume. For nonspherical particles, volume refers to the volume
    of the particle-forming substance, not that of the circumferential
    sphere (which can be derived from diameter_max). If the particle

The zenith angle grid, on which the *cloudbox_field* is stored. 
This grid is used for RT calculations inside the cloudbox, therefore
the grid has to be defined if the cloudbox is activated by the flag
*cloudbox_on*. Furthermore the zenith angle grid is also used for RT
calculations of clear-sky *spectral_radiance_field*. 
The grid must be sorted in increasing order, with no repetitions.

Usage:      Set by the user.
