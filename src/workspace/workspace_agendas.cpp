   radiation field (*doit_rte_agenda*).

-  ``doit_scat_fieldCalcLimb``: This method calculates the scattering

   the data is interpolated on equidistant angular grids. 
   Especially for limb, where a very fine zenith angle grid 
   resolution is required for the RT transfer part, this method

A very similar method in plane parallel approximation is

    faster than the above one. The drawback is that it is less
    accurate, especially for limb geometries and large off-nadir

was invented. It is very slow and should therefore only 
be used for test cases:

A propagation path step is defined as the path between some point

and this agenda performs the calculations to determine such a 
partial propagation path. The starting point is normally a grid 
crossing point, but can also be an arbitrary point inside the 
atmosphere, such as the sensor position. Only points inside the 
model atmosphere are handled.

The communication between this agenda and the calling method is 
handled by *ppath_step*. That variable is used both as input and 
output to *ppath_step_agenda*. The agenda gets back *ppath_step* 
as returned to the calling method and the last path point hold by 
the structure is accordingly the starting point for the new 
calculations. If a total propagation path shall be determined, this
agenda is called repeatedly until the starting point of the 
propagation path is found and *ppath_step* will hold all path 
steps that together make up *ppath*. The starting point is included
in the returned structure. 

The path is determined by starting at the end point and moving 
backwards to the starting point. The calculations are initiated by 
filling *ppath_step* with the practical end point of the path. 
This is either the position of the sensor (true or hypothetical), 
or some point at the top of the atmosphere (determined by
geometrical calculations starting at the sensor). This 
initialisation is not handled by *ppath_step_agenda* (but by 
the internal function ppath_start_stepping). 

The *ppath_step_agenda* put in points along the propagation path 
at all crossings with the grids, tangent points and points of 
surface reflection. It is also allowed to make agendas that put in 
additional points to fulfil some criterion, such as a maximum 
distance along the path between the points. Accordingly, the 
number of new points of each step can exceed one.
