Getting started
===============

This *getting started* guide provides a basic introduction to the usage of the
**arts** Python package. It is separated into two parts. The first one, which
describes the interactive ARTS interface, provides an introduction on how to
control ARTS from Python. The second one provides a list of the Python classes
which are available for the manipulation of built-in ARTS data types.
