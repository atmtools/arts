pyarts
======

**pyarts** is the Python interface for the
`Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator <https://www.radiativetransfer.org>`_
(ARTS). It provides

-  an interactive interface to the ARTS engine for running radiative transfer
   simulations,
-  Python implementations of many ARTS built-in types for the manipulation
   of input data and the evaluation simulation results.

Installation
------------

Pre-compiled binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pre-compiled binaries of the ARTS interface including the ARTS engine for
performing RT simulations can be installed from the
`Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/pyarts>`_ (PyPI):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyarts


Building from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you build ARTS from source, then the Python interface will be installed
automatically.
