README for AMI (ARTS Matlab interface). AMI is a set of Matlab
functions for communication with ARTS, and other functions to make
your Matlab life simpler.

The core of the interface to ARTS is found in the folders arts/ and
hmatrix/, while the other folders contain different handy Matlab
functions of more general character.

The functions are sorted as:

arts/      : Interface functions to ARTS.
file/      : Functions to get file information or to create files. 
             This folder contains also functions to manipulate data read
             from linefiles (spectroscopic data).
hmatrix/   : Functions to set up the H transfer matrix.
math/      : Various math functions.
path/      : Functions to handle paths and directories.
physics/   : Physical and geometrical functions.
plot/      : Functions for plotting and printing.
retrieval/ : Help functions for retrieval, e.g. to set up grids.

Information for the individual functions are obtained by reading
the functions headings, or by using help in Matlab, e.g.:

help vec2col

You add the AMI folders to your search path and sets some global
constants by running init.m.


Good luck,
