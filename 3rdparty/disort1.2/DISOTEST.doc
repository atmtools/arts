          DISORT Test Driver Documentation

There are two groups of DISORT test problems.  One group aims to test
ACCURACY, the other CONSISTENCY.


ACCURACY PROBLEMS
-----------------

The aim of the 'accuracy' problems is to compare the results with
answers obtained on an IBM 3081 computer running DISORT entirely
in double precision ( 14 significant digits ).  These problems are
not chosen to be comprehensive but rather to test extreme values
of the input parameters.  Hence, in cases where published tables
exist, only a few cases from the tables are examined.

NOTE:  When it is clear that a result should be zero -- for example,
the up-flux from a zero-albedo surface should be zero -- the
"correct" answer is set to zero.  In fact DISORT will usually
return a very small non-zero number in such cases, whose value
depends intimately on the computer being used.

In parentheses beneath each result is printed its ratio to the
"correct" answers (contained in DATA statements).  This ratio
is calculated by a small routine RATIO which protects against
under- and over-flow and attempts to return reasonable results.
If the ratio threatens to bump up against the largest or smallest
number representable on your computer, it will be set to that
number (roughly).  This can make the ratios differ from one
computer to the next.  However, most of the ratios should be
unity to at least a few significant digits.  If you run in less
than 14 digit precision, a few ratios will differ from unity,
and a few of those will just print as '*********' because you
will be comaring very small numbers which are sensitive to
precision, and when they differ by orders of magnitude their
ratio will not print in the supplied F format.  Some problems
were designed specifically to show this precision dependence,
so that the user has fair warning about running in low precision.

The worst degradation in accuracy from running in low precision
occurs for non-absorbing cases (single scattering albedo = 1),
because the eigenvalue problem becomes degenerate and very
sensitive to round-off errors in that case.

Test problems 1 to 5 involve single purely scattering layers
with successively more difficult phase functions.  Subcases are
for varying optical depths and single scattering albedos.  For
problems 1 and 3, Van de Hulst defines

   reflectivity   = pi * U0(top) / incident flux
   transmissivity = pi * U0(bottom) / incident flux

where U0 = azimuthally-averaged intensity.  We picked
incident flux = pi  so that our U0's are equal to Van de
Hulst's reflectivities and transmissivities.  DISORT reflected
and transmitted fluxes must be divided by the incident flux (pi)
to compare to the 'FLUX' column in Van de Hulst. (Get DISORT
transmitted flux by summing the direct and diffuse parts.)

Test problem 6 checks purely absorbing cases with an
increasingly complex mix of boundary and internal sources.
Solutions can be compared with exact analytic results.

Test problem 7 checks a general emitting/absorbing/scattering
medium with one computational layer and an
increasingly complex bottom reflectivity condition.

Test problem 8 checks an absorbing/isotropic-scattering
medium with two computational layers and isotropic incidence
at the top boundary.  Solutions can be compared to published
results.

Test problem 9 checks a general emitting/absorbing/scattering
medium with every computational layer different.  Cases A,B
can be compared to published results.  It also checks the special
case in PLKAVG where the two wavenumbers are close.


CONSISTENCY PROBLEMS
--------------------

The aim of the 'consistency' problems is to compare the results
obtained on two successive calls to DISORT, for identical
problem structures but taking differing paths through the program.
The answers obtained on the first call are saved and used to
calculate ratios after the second call.  Thus, ratios are not
printed after the first call (but answers are).

Test problem 10 checks that  USRANG = FALSE and  USRANG = TRUE
give identical results for the same set of angles.  It also
checks the special case branch for a 2x2 eigenvalue problem.

Test problem 11 checks that identical answers are obtained when
user levels in a single layer are replaced by computational levels.

Test problem 12 checks whether the shortcut for large absorption
optical depth (setting intensities to zero below a certain
absorption optical depth) is sufficiently accurate.  This is a
'worst case' problem in which a bottom boundary of albedo unity is
reflecting just below the cutoff level.  The user must decide
if he minds having large percent errors in intensities
which are negligibly small compared to the incident intensities.

Test problem 13 checks the option of determining albedo and
transmissivity for many sun angles at once.  Only fluxes are
involved.


NOTE:  The references cited in some of the test problems
       can be found in the DISORT documentation file.

       In the Garcia and Siewert tables ( cf. test problems 4
       and 5 ) the sign of the zenith angle is reversed from the
       convention used in DISORT.


** WARNING **

     Every effort has been made to make the test problems
independent of each other, so that 'hangover' values from one
problem do not unintentionally become input to the next; 
however, it is impossible to test all possible permutations
to be sure this is really true, and we could easily have
overlooked an isolated hangover or two.  Furthermore, for the
cases WITHIN a given problem, we make full use of hangover
values;  thus re-arranging these cases is almost certain to
lead to incorrect results.

     Therefore, in modifying these test problems or devising
their own, users should:

(a) be very careful to set all input variables to DISORT before
calling it

(b) be aware of those few DISORT arguments that function as both
input and output, and not assume these retain their initial
values across multiple DISORT calls.
