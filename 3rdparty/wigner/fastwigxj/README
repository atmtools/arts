1. Overview
===========

FASTWIGXJ evaluates Wigner 3j, 6j and 9j symbols quickly by lookup in
precalculated tables.  When a symbol does not exist in the table, it
is evaluated directly using WIGXJPF [1], which also is used to produce
the tables.

For 3j and 6j symbols, the lookup table is organised by direct
indexing as described in [2] using Regge symmetries.  For 9j symbols
the precalculated symbols are stored in a hash table, and
canonicalised before lookup using permutation and reflection
symmetries.  9j symbols can also be evaluated by fallback to summing
6j symbols.

In general, for reasonably-sized precalculated tables, the time spent
for symmetry calculations are smaller than the (unavoidable) actual
memory lookup (around 100 ns).

FASTWIGXJ can also keep dynamic hash tables of symbols, which is
useful when only a subset of larger symbols than can be stored in the
fixed tables are used many times.  The hash tables are filled when
symbols are calculated on demand.  If too many symbols are touched,
the tables are gradually cleared using a least-recently-used scheme.

3a. Prerequisite library
========================

FASTWIGXJ depends on the WIGXJPF library to evaluate the Wigner
symbols accurately.  See:

http://fy.chalmers.se/subatom/wigxjpf/

To build, it need to be placed alongside fastwigxj in the directory
structure.  Short build instructions:

cd ..
wget http://fy.chalmers.se/subatom/wigxjpf/wigxjpf-1.10.tar.gz
tar -zxvf wigxjpf-1.10.tar.gz
cd wigxjpf-1.10
make
cd ../fastwigxj-1.4

The build of FASTWIGXJ will automatically use the version of
WIGXJPF found with the highest version number (searching ../wigxjpf*/).
(Currently, at least version 1.2 is required for compilation to work.)


3b. Compilation
===============

All necessary configuration is performed during build.  The library is
compiled by issuing:

make

Test evaluation of some small symbols (a few seconds runtime) can be
performed by:

make test

The fortran interface is pure C code and compiled with the library above.
Testing it requires a fortran compiler, e.g. gfortran:

make flookup.test FC=gfortran

It also requires that the fortran test of WIGXJPF was performed.

It is recommended to compile the library itself using gcc (the GNU
Compiler Collection).  clang (LLVM) does not have support for
float128, thus cannot do 9j-by-6j fallback.  Currently, icc (the Intel
Compiler) cannot compile the library itself, but can be used to
compile and link a using program.


4. Creation of precalculated tables
===================================

To create a precalculated table of 3j symbols, using Regge symmetries,
valid for all symbols with max j <= 25 (and quite a few larger ones;
the limit for E is effectively 2*j), do:

bin/hash_js --max-E-3j=50 /dev/null ./table_50.3j

Similarly for a table of 6j symbols, using Regge symmetries, valid for
all symbols with max j <= 20 (and quite a few larger ones; the limit
for E is effectively 2*j), do:

bin/hash_js --max-E-6j=40 /dev/null ./table_40.6j

To produce a table of 6j symbols suitable for fallback use during
evaluation of 9j symbols:

bin/hash_js --max-E-6j=40 --float128 /dev/null ./table_40_float128.6j

For 9j symbols, the symbols to store must first be enumerated (here for
all symbols with max j <= 8; the limit given is for 2*j):

bin/gen_9j --flat-lim=16 | bin/combine_js | bin/unique_js ./comb_16.9j

And then calculated and hashed:

bin/hash_js ./comb_16.9j ./hashed_16.9j

It may be advantageous to enumerate an 'assymmetric' symbol
distribution, where j3,j6,j7,j8 are twice as large and j9 four times
as large as the maximum of j1,j2,j4,j5 (the limit given is 2*j for
j1,j2,j4,j5):

bin/gen_9j --lim=10 | bin/combine_js | bin/unique_js ./comb_10_assym.9j

bin/hash_js ./comb_10_assym.9j ./hashed_10_assym.9j

Some typical table sizes (GB):

kind:   limit:   max j:
                    10     20     30     40     50     60     70
3j      E: 2*j  0.0005  0.009  0.066   0.26   0.77   1.88   3.99
6j      E: 2*j   0.002   0.07   0.72    3.7   13.6   39.4   97.0

kind:   limit:   max j:
                     4      5      6      7      8     10     12     16
9j      flat    0.0005  0.004  0.016  0.033   0.13   1.07    4.3   34.3
9j      assym    0.016  0.067   0.26    1.1    4.3   17.2    137


4a. Large symbols - limits for dynamic tables
==============================================

For symbols with large values of j, the canonicalisation routines
could overflow the internal representations.  Either due to using too
many bits for each value (9j), or due to the calculation of table
indices exceeding the 64-bit representation (3j, 6j).

Instead of this happening, the routines will return a special
indicator, that will lead to direct evaluation by WIGXJPF.

This does not affect the precalculated tables, as memory constraints
give much lower limits on which j can be included.  It does however
mean that also the dynamic tables will not be efficient above these
values, since all requests are served by direct evaluation, as the
results are not stored in the dynamic hash tables.

The limit for 9j symbols is j <= 63.5.

For 3j and 6j symbols, the limit is on the largest internal
contributor to the Rasch-Yu index, which rougly translates to a j of
~3550 for 3j and ~800 for 6j.

(These limits could be increased by using a different hash key scheme
(3j, 6j) or a different operating scheme for the canonicalisation
routine altogether (9j); please contact the author.)


5. Library interfaces
=====================

FASTWIGXJ is intended for use as a library within other programs.
Several interfaces are provided and described below.  All lookup
functions are multi-thread safe.  They all follow the same scheme:

0) Setup of precalculated tables.  When large symbols will be
   requested, it is suggested to make them as large as possible, given
   the memory available.  The tables are shared between multiple
   threads in the using programs.  The tables are loaded using mmap,
   such that they also will be shared between multiple processes
   running on the same machine.

Within the using program:

1) Loading of the precalculated tables.

2) Setup of WIGXJPF, in case the tables does not hold all symbols
   that will be requested.

3) Lookup symbols.
   Repeat...

4) (Optional) print statistics.

5) Free the memory used by the tables.

6) Also free memory used by WIGXJPF.

Interfaces:

For each kind of symbol, there are interfaces with different call
sequences.  This is to accomodate both easy change from other means of
evaluating Wigner 3j, 6j and 9j symbols, and to also allow to maximise
the performance.

- Direct interface with individual arguments.

- Direct interface with a pointer to list of arguments.

- Split interface with a pointer to list of arguments.  The split
  allows to separate the canonicalisation by symmetry and prefetch the
  memory before issuing the actual memory lookup.  This way,
  canonicalisation and lookup of several symbols can be interleaved.

Independent of interface, error handling is brutal: if a symbol that
exceeds the tables cannot be found, it will be evaluated by fallback
to WIGXJPF.  If the requested symbol exceeds the setup or temporary
storage of WIGXJPF, that library will print an error message and
terminate the program.


5a. Simple C interface
======================

See function prototypes in inc/fastwigxj.h.

0) #include "fastwigxj.h"

1) size_t fastwigxj_load("test_table_18.3j", 3, NULL);

   For a table with 6j or 9j symbols, change 3 to 6 or 9.  To load
   a 6j table with 128-bit floating point values for 9j-by-6j fallback
   calculations, use 7.

   The storage space allocated is returned.

2) Call the initialisation routines of WIGXJPF in case the tables are
   not large enough to handle all symbols that will be requested.

3) double fw3jja(int two_j1, int two_j2, int two_j3,
                 int two_m1, int two_m2, int two_m3);

   And similar for 6j and 9j symbols.

   Note that the arguments are to be given as integers, with twice the
   numeric value (this is what jj tries to indicate).
   I.e. half-integer arguments will be passed as odd integers.

   Also note the alternative call sequences described in the next
   section below.

4) fastwigxj_print_stats();
 
5) fastwigxj_unload(3);

   And similar for other loaded tables.

6) Release WIGXJPF memory.

Example use can be found in example/clookup.c.

To compile and link with FASTWIGXJ:

CFLAGS += -Ipath-to-fastwigxj/inc/
LDFLAGS += -Lpath-to-fastwigxj/lib/
LDLIBS += -lfastwigxj -lm

Linking with WIGXJPF is also required, to provide the fallback
routines.  Note that for the time being, it is necessary to also link
with the quadmath (__float128) parts of WIGXJPF (see section 5d of the
WIGXJPF instructions).


5b. Alternative (more efficient) C interface
============================================
   
For the different call sequences, there are several functions with
different names, see inc/fastwigxj.h.  The naming scheme:

fwXjj[|s|s4][a|l|_canon|_prefetch|_get][_nz][_float128]

where X is 3, 6 or 9.

The postfix nz means no-trivial-0-check, i.e. the c14n routine will
not guard against invalid arguments, or arguments that correspond to
symbols that are trivially 0.  Note that if such symbols are
requested, WRONG values WILL be returned.  (This interface is not
exposed to the user yet).

s: struct:   use structure as arguments

s4: struct4: use structure with 4 symbols as arguments, to do
             c14n calculation in parallel

a: args:  do a full c14n and retrieval of one symbol, using a call
          sequence with 5, 6 or 9 arguments.

l: list:  do a full c14n and retrieval of one symbol, using a call
          sequence with a pointer to a list holding 5, 6, or 9 arguments.

_canon:   do the c14n of one symbol, using a pointer to a list.

_prefetch: do the memory prefetch, given the the prepared c14n information.

_get:     get the actual value of one symbol, the pointer to the original
          list of arguments is needed, in case the symbol is not within
          the table and a fallback calculation is required.

_nz:      do not do trivial-0-check, i.e. triangle and integer sum
          relationships of arguments.  WARNING: if symbol not fulfilling
	  these checks is requested with _nz, *wrong* results will be
	  returned (crashes / segmentation faults could also happen).

_float128: retrieve float128 results (requires such table, only for 6j
	   currently.)


5c. Dynamic hash tables
=======================

The dynamic hash tables are (currently) kept per kind of symbol,
i.e. 3, 6j and 9j.  They are created by requesting storage space for a
certain number of symbols.  Note that the hash tables handle
collisions within the table, and as a consequence, only allow to be
3/4 filled.  When more symbols are calculated on-the-fly,
approximately 1/16 of the symbols are removed from the dynamic hash
tables.  The removed symbols are the ones which have been accessed the
longest time ago.  The hash table is accessed using the index
calculated such that symbols that are equal due to symmetries only
occupy one entry.

It is a good idea to still load some precalculated tables when using
the dynamic hash tables.  This is particularly the case if trivially-0
symbols are evaluated, since they are served by a fixed entry in the
precalculated tables.

Initialise a dynamic hash table by calling:

1) size_t fastwigxj_dyn_init(3 /*or 6, or 9 */, entries);
   size_t fastwigxj_thread_dyn_init(3 /*or 6, or 9 */, entries);

   entries will be rounded up to a power of two.  A total of 17 bytes
   (in two different arrays, 16+1) will be allocated per entry.

   The storage space allocated is returned.

   fastwigxj_dyn_init() and fastwigxj_thread_dyn_init() do exactly the
   same thing.  By using fastwigxj_thread_dyn_init(), it is ensured
   that the FASTWIGXJ library was compiled with threading support.
   Otherwise, the on-the-fly modification of the tables will cause
   wrong values to be used.


The dynamic tables can be free'd by calling:

2) void fastwigxj_dyn_free(3 /*or 6, or 9 */);


5d. Simple FORTRAN interface
============================

The fortran interface is analog to the C interface described above.  A
'f' is prepended to each function name.  All arguments except rx and x
are of type 'integer*4' and return values of type 'real*8'.  The
intermediate arguments rx and x are of type 'integer*8'.

A small example program can be found in example/flookup.f.

The interface specifications are in a module ffastwigxj, which is placed
in the mod/ directory during compilation of the FORTRAN test program
(which also selects the FORTRAN compiler to use).  Compilation of
FORTRAN programs thus need to include also that directory:

FCFLAGS += -I path-to-wigxjpf/mod/

Note that the module fwigxjpf of WIGXJPF also is needed initialising
the use of fallback routines.


6. Look-up statistics
=====================

To help investigate the efficiency (coverage) of the precalculated
tables, the library counts every look-up, and whether it was serviced
by the tables, or had to be fully calculated.  The overhead of this
accounting is small compared to the actual look-up.  Currently, the
accounting is not multi-thread-aware, so may in such cases miss some
counts.

The statistics is given for 3j, 6j and 9j symbols separately.
For each symbol, the following items are counted:

- Trivial 0

  Number of symbols that are trivially 0.  Trivially 0 symbols are
  detected early in the canonicalisation routines, and will do a quick
  retrieval of a zero value in the tables.  Still, they are not for
  free:

  If your code has a large (even dominating) fraction of trivial-0
  symbols being looked up, it is strongly recommended to review the
  loops surrounding the symbol calculations.  Most often, it is
  possible to use more careful (stringent) limits on the j and m
  values that are being traversed such that trivially 0 symbol are
  avoided.  This is especially important when the values of several
  symbols are multiplied, as some trivially 0-valued symbol might make
  the more expensive evaluation of other factors useless.

  The reason in the first place to use FASTWIGXJ is to speed up
  calculations that use many Wigner symbols.  The fastest way is to
  not call it at all...

- Hits

  Total number of retrievals that were serviced by the loaded tables.
  (Note that this for technical reasons include trivially 0 symbols.)

- Hits non-trivially-0

  The difference between the two above measured values.

- Dynamic hits

  Number of evaluations satisfied by the dynamic hash tables.

- Dynamic trips

  Number of dynamic lookups that had to be restarted, due to other
  thread performing a reduction at the desired location.

- Dynamic C14N overflows

  Number of dynamic lookups/insertations that failed due to overflow
  in the canonicalisation of the symbol.

  These will also be accounted as directly calculated.

- 9j by 6j

  Number of 9j symbols that could be evaluated by (hopefully lookup)
  of 6j symbols.

- Calculated

  Number of symbols that had to be evaluated directly.

- Total lookups

  The sum of hits and calculated above.

- Dynamic table reductions

  Number of times the dynamic table was about to use > 3/4 items,
  and thus free'd 1/16 of the oldest items.

  If this happens often, and the number of calculated symbols are
  comparable to the number of dynamic hits, then the tables are too
  small to be effective.

- Table entries

  Number of entries in the precalculated tables (currently loaded).

- Dynamic table entries

  Number of entries in the dynamic hash tables (currently allocated).
