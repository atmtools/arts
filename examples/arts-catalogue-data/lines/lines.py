This file will showcase how you can load line data from arts-cat-data into the
workspace and do the required setups to perform a simple forward calculations
using this data

Note that this example presumes that you have set the environment variable
ARTS_DATA_PATH to contain a path to a local copy of both arts-cat-data and
arts-xml-data before you import pyarts.  Please check that this is the case
if the example does not work for you.  You can easily check if this path is
set by adding the following two lines at the top of this pyarts-controlfile:

```
import os
print(os.environ.get("ARTS_DATA_PATH"))
```

Set ws.abs_species to the species tags that you wish to use.  Pure line-by-line
calculations sets the species by an expanded form of the AFGL tag system in
ARTS.  This example sets the isotopologue to O16-O16, "O2-66", to include all
lines of said isotopologue into the absorption species tag list

There are many ways to customize this tag.  The following things are examples
of what is possible:
1) Change "O2-66" to "O2".  Consequence: Not just the O2-66 isotopologue is
    included in the absorption species tag list but all molecular oxygen lines
    are included.  Note that "O2-*" is the same thing as "O2".
2) Change "O2-66" into "O2-66,O2-68".  Consequence: Not just O2-66 but also
    the O16-O18 isotopologue is included as the first species tag.
    Note that for forward calculation purposes, writing ["O2-66,O2-68"] or
    ["O2-66", "O2-68"] includes the same lines but changes the layout of
    ws.abs_lines_per_species
3) Change "O2-66" into "O2-66-40e9-120e9".  Consequence:  Still only the O2-66
    isotopologue is considered, but all lines below 40 GHz and all lines above
    120 GHz are considered part of another species tag.  Note that you can
    write your list as ["O2-66-40e9-120e9,O2-66"] to still include all lines,
    though this would in this particular example be a trivial waste of time
4) Change "O2-66" to "O2-Z-66".  Consequence:  You will activate Zeeman effect
    calculations for O2-66.  Warning: Zeeman effect calculations are slow
    because they require several times more calls to core line-by-line
    functions.  Note that one way to speed up these calculations is to combine
    the tags with one of the examples above.  If you write your list of species
    tags as ["O2-Z-66-110e9-120e9", "O2-66"], only absorption lines between
    110 and 120 GHz will be treated as Zeeman-affected, but the rest of the
    lines are still included in the calculations.
5) Change ["O2-66"] to ["O2-66", "H2O-161"].  Consequence: The water
    isotopologue H1-O16-H1 is added to your list of line-by-line absorption
    species.  Note that you can add as many species as you wish.  Also note
    that you are not allowed to write "O2-66,H2O-161" but must separate this
    as written at the top of this listitem.
5) Change ["O2-66"] to ["O2-66", "O2"].  Consequence: All oxygen lines are
    in your list of line-by-line absorption species.  Note that you can
    add as many species as you wish.  Also note that you are allowed to
    write "O2-66,O2".

ws.abs_speciesSet(species=["O2-66"])

"""

Load the line data of the absorption tags defined in ws.abs_species into the
ARTS line catalog at ws.abs_lines_per_species

The line data file is expected to be named as a line-by-line species tag.  So
for our species tag of "O2-66" above, the reading routine will look for the file
name "lines/O2-66.xml".  The search paths for these files prefer paths relative
to the current working directory above this available elsewhere on the system.
However, "lines/O2-66.xml" does exist in a fully up-to-date version of
arts-cat-data (if you ARTS version is recent enough) so it is likely that this
is the file that is selected for reading.

The resulting ws.abs_lines_per_species will have outer size 1,
len(ws.abs_lines_per_species.value) == 1, after running this file as provided
because the size and shape of ws.abs_species is linked to the size and shape
of ws.abs_lines_per_species.

If you change your tags following one of the examples above, the following
are the consequences:
1) Change "O2-66" to "O2".  ws.abs_lines_per_species will now contain not just
    O2-66 lines but also other isotopologues.  The len of
    ws.abs_lines_per_species will not change.
2) Change "O2-66" into "O2-66,O2-68".  ws.abs_lines_per_species will now
    contain not just O2-66 lines but also lines of O2-68.  If written as
    ["O2-66,O2-68"] the len of ws.abs_lines_per_species will not change.  If
    written as ["O2-66", "O2-68"] the len of ws.abs_lines_per_species is now 2.
3) Change "O2-66" into "O2-66-40e9-120e9".  This will simply limit the number
    of lines in the line catalog.
4) Change "O2-66" to "O2-Z-66".  The line catalog will look exactly the same
    but the calculations inside will change significantly
5) Change ["O2-66"] to ["O2-66", "H2O-161"].  The len of
    ws.abs_lines_per_species is now 2 as the first entry are lines of O2-66 and
    the second entry are lines of H2O-161
6) Change ["O2-66"] to ["O2-66", "O2"].  The len of
    ws.abs_lines_per_species is now 2 as the first entry are lines of O2-66 and
    the second entry are all other lines of O2.  Note therefore that ["O2", "O2-66"]
    also has the len 2, but that all lines are now in the first entry.

With abs_species and abs_lines_per_species both defined, you can (and must)
