# Import the module

# Create a workspace

"""
Indices can be set from the built-in python int.

It is necessary to create an index object first, since the workspace
variable must know the type.
"""
ws.ind = pyarts.arts.Index(1)
print("Should contain 1:           ", ws.ind)

"""
Once an index exist on the workspace, you can set it directly from int.
"""
ws.ind = 2
print("Should contain 2:           ", ws.ind)


"""
What follows are some examples of how to set other types of workspace
variables.  The general rule is that you can set a workspace variable
from any python object that has a corresponding ARTS type.  For
example, you can set a string from a python string, a matrix from a
numpy array, etc.

Many more types are supported.  Please look at the documentation of the
respective Workspace Group for more information on how to initialize them.
