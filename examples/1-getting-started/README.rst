The following document contains examples for how to run
pyarts.  It is meant as an ever-expanding simple go-to
list of well-documented solutions and insight into
problems you might run into using Arts/pyarts.

Note that none of the examples are extensive, as they
are run continuously during the development of Arts/pyarts
to ensure consistent results and experience.  Feel free
to take these examples and expand them for your personal
use-case.

To date it consists of

1. Basics --- the basic interfaces of the pyarts package. 
   No real physics, just pure definition of how the workspace
   and its variables can be set and accessed.
2. Clearsky radiance --- shows some examples of how to set up
   pyarts to run clearsky simulations.

Once you're familiar with the basics, have a look at
:doc:`the other examples <examples>` which demonstrate more ARTS
features.
