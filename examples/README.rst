This is a collection of examples for ARTS.

All examples are located in the `examples` directory of the current branch of ARTS
and are run as part of the ARTS continuous integration (CI) system.

Each example is a self-contained Python script or notebook that can be run independently,
sometimes requiring the ARTS data to be available.
