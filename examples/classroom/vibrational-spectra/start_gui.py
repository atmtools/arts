# This will apply a cutoff of each absorption line at a frequency of 750 GHz
# away from the pressure shifted line center.  The value at the cutoff frequency
# is subsequently used to remove the value from within the line center.
# the latter modification is in line with how water continua models deal with
# some of its unknown or just difficult to model absorption features, however
# we will not consider this absorption in the current example
# NOTE: Using a cutoff frequency across all species like this degrades the
# quality of the absorption calculations, which can be seen by changing the
# Y-scale of the absorption to logarithmic
