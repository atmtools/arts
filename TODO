SAB 2000-01-30: Oliver: Turn off all debugging options with ./configure flag.
                (Do not give the -g flag to the compiler, set NDEBUG.)

AvE 2000-08-22: Check that partition funciton coefficients are valid, 
                some species are not defined, nevertheless a dummy
                partition function coefficient is given. check that 
                the returned value of the partition function (NOT
                the ratio) is larger than zero after calling.

AvE 04.09.2000: Agnes Perrin mentioned that the simple scheme to calculate
	       	partition functions at different temperature is accurate enough,
		so one should actually perfom an accuracy check.

		simple scheme: 

		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot(T)*(T'/T)**1.5 for non linear molecule  
		and
		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot(T)*(T'/T)   for a linear molecule

		This way might be more efficient timewise.

AvE 2000-09-27: There is optimization potential in the lineshape.cc file,
		read FIXME comments over there.

SAB 2000-11-08: Send information about ARTS to Gerald Nedolua for
                destribution to NDSC.

SAB 2000-11-10: Adapt sample control file in user guide to new method
                and WSV names.  

SAB 2000-12-04: Make WSV groups (groups.cc) and Token types (token.h,
                token.cc) consistent. (Do this after online doc in
                methods.cc is updated to avoid conflicts when people
                check in.) 

AvE 2001-04-03: I just tried to run some calculations with arts and the 
                new hitran 2000 edition, and of course, ran into problems. 
                I did update arts a bit with the new hitran species, but 
		just had to find out that more has changed. For example 
		Hitran has now more H2O isotopes.
 
		Somebody has to update arts to the 2000 edition. 

SAB 2001-09-18: Thomas, please move cloud water vapor saturation
		adjustment out of AtmFromRaw1D as soon as
                possible. Make a standalone
		method out of this. Use only lowercase letters for keywords, to be
		consistent with other methods.

SAB 2001-09-18: Thomas, please rename seltags to seltgs. Tgs means
		"tag groups", not "tags". (Each element of seltgs is a tag group,
		consisting of one or more tags.)

PE 2001-09-19:  All: WRITE GOOD AND DETAILED ON-LINE INFORMATION.

PE 2001-09-19:  All: The consistency of function input should be checked. 
                I will make some functions to faciliate this.

PE 2001-09-19:  All: remove old pieces of code in the files that no longer
		is of any interest.

OLE 2001-09-21: Make the HDF part optional. Let the configure script determine
                whether HDF is installed or not and depending on that include the
                binary methods. To make this more convient all HDF related functions
                should be moved into a separate source file.

SAB 2001-09-24: Thomas: Please put in detailed online documentation
                for cont_description_names.  

SAB 2001-09-24: Automatically remove WSVs that are no longer
                needed. (Do this after the workshop, though, seems to
                be not too urgent.) 

SAB 2001-09-24: After the workshop, implement a new ASCII output
                format. Think about consistant naming of
                methods. Don't forget los, lines, lines_per_tg, and
                raw_vmrs read/write.

SAB 2001-09-25: Patrick, can you please rename the group LOS to Los,
                in order to be consistent with the other group names?

SAB 2001-09-25: Rename Array<OneTag> to TagGroup and Array<
                Array<OneTag> > to ArrayOfTagGroup. (After update of
                online docs, to avoid conflicts.)

SAB 2001-09-25: Thomas: Write doxygen header for function
                interpp_cloud in file atm_funcs.cc.
