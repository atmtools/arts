  instruments (sensor_responseMetMM)


Other Changes
=============

- New ARTSCAT-6 catalog format to accomodate the new line-by-line
  infrastructure.  A description can be found in the ARTS Theory Guide.

- New format of scattering meta data (see online doc of scat_meta_single).

- Cleaner separation of scattering data of the different scattering species:
  scat_data and scat_meta now organized as ArrayOfArrayOfSingleScattering/MetaData
  with each high-level array element corresponding to one scattering species,
  each lower level array element corresponding to one scattering element.

- ScatteringParticlesSelect doesn't select on material anymore (governed by
  sorting scattering data into ArrayOfArray...). Size range selection changed to
  diameter based selection instead of radius based.

- Default input format for compact batch atmospheres changed from ArrayOfMatrix
  to ArrayOfGriddedField. Selection of fields from input data now purely on the
  basis of abs_species and scat_species definitions.

- Changed tagging mechanism of field_names in
  batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrix. Now absorption species and
  scattering species related fields have to be marked as such. Scattering
  species fields additionally require a tag to indicate the type of field (mass
  density, mass flux, number density).

- DoitInit required to be called before DoitGetIncoming.

- Initialization of the first guess field is now done outside of
  doit_mono_agenda. The order is DoitInit, DoitGetIncoming and then the
  initializiation (e.g. cloudbox_fieldSetClearsky or cloudbox_fieldSetFromPrecalc)

- Create WSMs are not allowed to be called inside Agendas anymore. Avoids
  confusion because variables are always global independent of where they are
  created.

- WSM DoitCloudboxFieldPut removed, not needed anymore.

- WSM doit_i_fieldSetFromPrecalc now takes a generic Tensor7
  (stored doit_i_field) instead of the removed WSV doit_i_field1D_spectrum.

- WSM DoitWriteIterationFields now takes a list of frequency indexes in
  addition to the iterations. Value to select all frequencies/iterations is now
  -1 instead of 0. Filenames are now unique based on frequency index and iteration
  counter.

- Polarisation index coding of left- and right hand circular polarisation
  changed. See on-line doc of sensor_pol for present coding. Before the wrong
  polarisation was obtained when using the sensor part to extract the V Stokes
  element.
  
- backend_channel_responseGaussian now takes Vectors instead of Numerics as
  inputs making it possible to define different responses for each channel.

- NetCDF support is disabled by default. If needed, it can be enabled with
  the cmake option -DENABLE_NETCDF=1

- batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrix does not support adding extra
  fields anymore. Use batch_atm_fields_compactAddConstant instead.

- Added new method OptimizeDoitPressureGrid for pressure grid optimization of 
  DOIT

- Added a convergence acceleration for DOIT calculations 

- New format of scattering data for azimuthally randomly oriented scatterers
  (formerly known as horizontally aligned or p30). See AUG. Old format data is
  automatically converted when read.

- Interfaces to scattering solvers Disort and RT4.

- new, more general approach for pnd_field calculation from particle (e.g.
  hydrometeor) fields and particle size distributions
  (pnd_fieldCalcFromParticleBulkProp) using ArrayOfAgenda.

- cloudboxSetAutomatically now takes only a single Tensor4 field collection, but
  can start from/update previously determined cloudbox_limits.

- scat_data now has to be preprocessed such that the f_grids of the scattering
  elements are either identical to the calculations f_grid or only have a single
  entry. Previous arbitrary-f_grid scat_data is now in scat_data_raw. DOIT and
  MC so far still use scat_data_raw.

- all WSM that set/calculate pnd_field now also output dpnd_field_dx initialized
  to the correct size according to jacobian_quantities. That includes, that
  jacobians need to be readily defined before these methods are called, or, more
  generalized, that jacobians have to be defined before the cloudbox is set.

- opt_prop_part_agenda removed. Internally replaced by method opt_prop_bulkCalc.
