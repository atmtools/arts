Overall considerations and decisions:
---
* Elevation is main altitude coordinate
* Positions and directions always in 3D
* Geodetic latitudes and zenith angles used throughout
* Atmosphere covers complete atmosphere
  - There is no atmosphere_dim
  - Make WSMs to check that path inside certain region
* The surface elevation is also global
  - Extrapolation as planned for atmosphere
* There are no master atmospheric grids
  - Grid positions removed from ppath
  - But ppaths can still be forced to include certain z, lat and lon
    > Optional to include all, could just be set of z
* The above means that basic version now is equidistant step length
* Introduce max total length of ppath, l_total_max
* Scattering domain:
  - Ignored when ppath calculated
    > MC can use l_total_max
  - Make WSMs to crop at cloudbox boundary
    > Include feature now handeled by path_inside_cloudbox_do
  - and according to scattering mass criterion (also extinction?) 
  - ppath_step now limited to DOIT
    > that is, start at a grid crossing demanded
* Longitudes must now be inside [-180,360].
  - Internally is [-180,180] default
  - See if old shift lon functions can be replaced
* refellipsoid is now [equatorial radius, polar radius]

Agendas:
---
ppath_agenda
  - Out: ppath
  - In: rte_pos, rte_los, ppath_lstep, ppath_ltotal, ppath_lraytrace
    (lengths input as there could be reason to vary them, by eg MC)
ppath_step_agenda
  - Out: ppath
  - In: ?

WSMs:

Other ideas:
---
* Cloudbox should be called scattering domain: scat_domain
* Make dedicated "iyHybrid" versions of DISORT and RT4
  - This main way to use RT4 in the future?
    > Allows to use fewer streams?
